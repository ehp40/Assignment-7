The best model was ARIMA(1,0,0) with a non-zero mean. Therefore, the data is stationary without differencing and is primarily driven by one autoregressive term. The AR(1) coefficient of 0.33 indicates mild persistence so that each month is influenced slightly by the previous month. The AIC (584.22) suggests that this model fits better than all other tested combinations, and the residuals represent white noise, indicating that this model is suitable for the data.
